# Borderless Coding Challenge

Challenge: Create a full stack application where a user can submit their passport file and get that verified by AWS Textrace.
Additionally, demonstrate the use of complex state management using Context API (Although this wouldn't need to be used in a production environment, this is purely done for demonstration purposes only for this code test.)

Additional functionalities to add (With more time):

# Add test cases, particularly for the utils functions, as they are difficult to test given the wide range of inputs

# Verify name, as this field is captured, but currently not used this is purely for demonstration of how to manage fields

# Add a DatePicker, for example

In order to test this codebase, run the following commands:

cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev

For the backend, you need to do

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
